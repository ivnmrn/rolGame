# Escape from Cratopia

Escape from Cratopia is an RPG text-based, you can interact with the story, characters, environments, and other stats.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```bash
pip3 install --user poetry
```
You can follow also the official [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

In this case, I have been using [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) to manage the DB and [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as an ORM.

To install SQLAlchemy:

```bash
pip3 install sqlalchemy
```

Also, you can see here the official [documentation](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html).

## Usage

Once you have poetry installed you just need to run 
```bash
poetry run python3 main.py
```
Now, you can start your adventure in the Cratopias Kingdom.
